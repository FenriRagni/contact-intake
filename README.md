# Mini-Project 
## Description
For the mini project of making a basic landing page I decided to make a "portfolio" website linking to my Github, LinkedIn, and a way to contact me. 

## Usage
The navigation links at the top open a new tab to my github profile and LinkedIn profile. The last one directs you further down the page to contact me. 

## Learning Points
* Starting from scratch is hard >.<
* Better understanding of positioninng elements
* How to use the form tag and it's associated tags
* Want to learn why github didn't want to render my footer styling until I typed this sentence >.<
